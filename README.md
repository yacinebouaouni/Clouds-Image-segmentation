# Clouds-Image-segmentation

Format: ![Alt Text](/Teaser_AnimationwLabels.gif)

In this competition you will be identifying regions in satellite images that contain certain cloud formations, with label names: Fish, Flower, Gravel, Sugar. For each image in the test set, you must segment the regions of each cloud formation label. Each image has at least one cloud formation, and can possibly contain up to all all four.

The images were downloaded from NASA Worldview. Three regions, spanning 21 degrees longitude and 14 degrees latitude, were chosen. The true-color images were taken from two polar-orbiting satellites, TERRA and AQUA, each of which pass a specific region once a day. Due to the small footprint of the imager (MODIS) on board these satellites, an image might be stitched together from two orbits. The remaining area, which has not been covered by two succeeding orbits, is marked black.
